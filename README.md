I have used python console for the task, however, it also runs as a Notebook (I did not do the Notebook-style formatting though).
data_parser.py - console script file
notebook_parser.ipynb - notebook file

I did not find the name of a country: I looked up the list of the country names in Asia and checked the presence of the relevant letters in the dataset, but there's only enough letters for OMAN and SUDAN and the letters are not in order. So, I guess, I did not understand the task...




TASK
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Dev Skills Review Exercise 1

In this repository you will find 3 versions of the same data, each version a bit more annoying to load.
Clone this repository, load up the files, and start slicing and dicing the data.

I'd like you to pick up problems in the dataset, and then treat them correctly to identify some insights that are evident.
We recommend jupyter notebook for the clarity, reproducibility, and emphasis on analysis that it facilitates, but you're welcome to use the tool that you are quickest with.

Don't get hung up on loading the files: slice and dice the data and come up with workable intel.

## Hints

- `head -c 100 <filename>  # shows the first 100 lines of a file`
- Pandas has a line terminator option, or you can use find/replace to clean the file.

## Bonus Points
If you can find me the name of a country in Asia hidden in the dataset.  This is one of the more evil issues you can encounter in dirty data.
